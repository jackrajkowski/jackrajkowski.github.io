## Projects
- [Foodhub Data Analysis](https://github.com/jackrajkowski/jackrajkowski.github.io/blob/main/Projects/FoodHub_Data_Analysis.ipynb)
  - The food aggregator company Foodhub has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. As a Data Scientist, I performed the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.

- [AllLife Bank Personal Loan Campaign](https://github.com/jackrajkowski/jackrajkowski.github.io/blob/main/Projects/AllLife_Bank_Classification_JackRajkowski.ipynb)
  - AllLife Bank is a US bank that has a growing customer base. The majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). As a Data scientist at AllLife bank, I built a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.

- [Thera Card Users Churn Prediction](https://github.com/jackrajkowski/jackrajkowski.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Thera_Churn_Classification_JackRajkowski.ipynb)
  - The Thera bank recently saw a steep decline in the number of users of their credit card. Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead the bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify which customers will leave their credit card services and why. As a Data scientist at Thera bank, I came up with a classification model that will help the bank improve its services so that customers do not renounce their credit cards.

- [Bank Churn Prediction: Neural Networks](https://github.com/jackrajkowski/jackrajkowski.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Bank_Churn_Prediction_JackRajkowski.ipynb)
  - Businesses like banks which provide service have to worry about problem of 'Customer Churn' i.e. customers leaving and joining another service provider. It is important to understand which aspects of the service influence a customer's decision in this regard. As a Data scientist with the bank, I need to build a neural network based classifier that can determine whether a customer will leave the bank or not in the next 6 months.

- [Plant Seedlings Classification](https://github.com/jackrajkowski/jackrajkowski.github.io/blob/main/Projects/Plant_Seedling_Classification_JackRajkowski.ipynb)
  - In recent times, the field of agriculture has been in urgent need of modernizing, since the amount of manual work people need to put in to check if plants are growing correctly is still highly extensive. Despite several advances in agricultural technology, people working in the agricultural industry still need to have the ability to sort and recognize different plants and weeds, which takes a lot of time and effort in the long term. The potential is ripe for this trillion-dollar industry to be greatly impacted by technological innovations that cut down on the requirement for manual labor, and this is where Artificial Intelligence can actually benefit the workers in this field, as the time and energy required to identify plant seedlings will be greatly shortened by the use of AI and Deep Learning. The objective was to Build a Convolutional Neural Netowrk to classify plant seedlings into their respective categories.
